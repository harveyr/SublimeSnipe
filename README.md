SublimeSnipe
============

This is a Sublime text plugin to execute code in your active view.

With no selection, it will execute everything in the view:

With an active selection, it will execute only the selected code:

I threw this together in a hurry. I'll try to make it a little more sophisticated shortly, including adding support for a few more languages.
