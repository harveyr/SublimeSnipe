SublimeSnipe
============

This is a Sublime Text plugin to execute code in your active view.

With no selection, it will execute everything in the view:

With an active selection, it will execute only the selected code:

Also supports **Javascript** (via node.js) and **PHP**.

I threw this together in a hurry. I'll try to make it a little more sophisticated shortly.

For example, I'm not sure what happens when your code hangs.
